# Design System

A personal design system built in React + TypeScript, developed alongside a Figma component library. This project is a learning exercise in bridging design and code as a UX/Product Designer.

- **Card** — Flexible card with optional header image, subtitle and footer actions
- **Dropdown** — Select input with custom styling
- **InputText** — Text input with validation states
- **Header / Page** — Layout components
- **Tokens** — Full design token system sourced from Figma (colors, typography, spacing, shadows)

## Built with

- [React](https://react.dev/) + TypeScript
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for component documentation
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for bundling
